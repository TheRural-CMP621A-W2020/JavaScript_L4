		<h3> Student Exercise(s)</h3>
		<ol>
			
			<li>	Create a web page that has three different products.  When you click on an image of the product, it will show you a larger view of the product.  It will also in a box beside the enlarged picture it will show a price and number in stock.  Use random generated numbers (between 10 and 100) for the price and random generated numbers (between 5 and 20) for the number in stock.  It is ok if the price and number in stock change each time the image is clicked.
